<h5> About the Experiment : </h5> <br>

<b>1. SUPERPOSITION THEOREM </b> <br>

The Aim of this experiment is to verify Superposition Theorem.<br>
<b>Learning Objectives:- </b> The Superposition Theorem is very useful for finding the voltages and currents in a circuit with two or more sources of supply.<br>

At the end of this experiment, students should be able to learn:<br>

1. To measure current by considering one source present at a time in a circuit.<br>
2. Compare the theoretical and practical values of current for verifying the superposition theorem.<br><br>

<b> 2. NORTON'S THEOREM </b> <br>

The Aim of this experiment is to verify Norton Theorem.<br>
<b>Learning Objectives:-</b>  Norton’s Theorem is a useful tool to analyze an electric circuit which reduces linear, active circuits and complex networks into a simple equivalent circuit.
At the end of this experiment, Students should be able to learn:<br>

1. To measure Short circuit current in a circuit.<br>
2. To measure Norton resistance in a circuit.<br>
3. To Compute the load current (I<sub>L</sub>) across load resistor by using the current divider rule.<br>
4. To Verify Norton’s Theorem by comparing analytically calculated values with practical one.<br><br>

<b> 3. MAXIMUM POWER TRANSFER THEOREM  </b> <br>

The Aim of this experiment is to verify the maximum power transfer theorem.<br>
<b>Learning Objectives:-</b> At the end of this experiment, students should be able to understand how maximum power is delivered to the load when load resistance is made equal to the source resistance.<br>

1. To measure voltage and current in a circuit.<br>
2. To calculate the maximum power delivered to the load by using maximum power formula. <br><br>

<b> 4. THEVENIN'S THEOREM </b>  <br>

The Aim of this experiment is to verify Thevenin Theorem.<br>
<b>Learning Objectives:-</b> The objective of this experiment is to examine an application of Thevenin’s Theorem.<br>

1. To measure Thevenin voltage in a circuit.<br>
2. To measure Thevenin equivalent resistance in a circuit.<br>
3. To compute the load current (I<sub>L</sub>) flowing through (R<sub>L</sub>) by using the Thevenin Formula.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       <b> I<sub>L</sub> = V<sub>th</sub>/(R<sub>th</sub> + R<sub>L</sub>) </b> <br>
4. To Verify Thevenin’s Theorem by comparing analytically calculated values with practical one.
