#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expositry
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 AND GATE:  Circuit shown in Simulator 1 contains AND gate with Diode logic in which the bulb at the output glows only if both the switches for two inputs are in ON state. Simulator 2 is for the assessment of the knowledge which user gains by working on simulator 1. Provide binary input to simulator, predict the output of AND gate and verify it by truth table. <br>
 OR GATE:  Circuit shown in Simulator 1 contains OR gate with Diode Logic in which the bulb at the output glows if any one or both the switches for two inputs are in ON state. Simulator 2 is for the assessment of the knowledge which user gains by working on simulator 1. Provide binary input to simulator, predict the output of OR gate and verify it by truth table.<br>
 NOT GATE:  Circuit shown in Simulator 1 contains transistor as NOT gate in which the bulb at the output glows if the switch for its input is in OFF state. Simulator 2 is for the assessment of the knowledge which user gains by working on simulator 1. Provide binary input to simulator, predict the output of NOT gate and verify it by truth table. <br>
 NAND GATE:  Circuit shown in Simulator 1 contains NAND gate with RTL (Resistor Transistor Logic) in which the bulb at the output glows if either one of them is in OFF state or both switches for its input are in OFF state. Simulator 2 is for the assessment of the knowledge which user gains by working on simulator 1. Provide binary input to simulator, predict the output of NAND gate and verify it by truth table.<br>
 NOR GATE:  Circuit shown in Simulator 1 contains NOR gate with RTL (Resistor Transistor Logic) in which the bulb at the output glows if both the switches for its input are in OFF state. Simulator 2 is for the assessment of the knowledge which user gains by working on simulator 1. Provide binary input to simulator, predict the output of NOR gate and verify it by truth table. <br>Ex-OR GATE:  Circuit shown in Simulator 1 contains Ex-OR gate with RTL (Resistor Transistor Logic) in which the bulb at the output glows if both the switches for its input are in different states. Simulator 2 is for the assessment of the knowledge which user gains by working on simulator 1. Provide binary input to simulator, Predict the output of Ex-OR gate and verify it by truth table.<br>
 Ex-NOR GATE:  Circuit shown in Simulator 1 contains Ex-NOR gate using RTL (Resistor Transistor Logic) in which the bulb at the output glows if both the switches for its input are in same states. Simulator 2 is for the assessment of the knowledge which user gains by working on simulator 1. Provide binary input to simulator, Predict the output of Ex-NOR gate and verify it by truth table.
